UAC source code is available here: [github.com/tclahr/uac](https://github.com/tclahr/uac)

## Dependencies

## Getting Started

Development for UAC is easy, as the tool is written in shell script. UAC uses the Bourne shell (/bin/sh) on the target system. By adhering to the Bourne shell, UAC remains portable and allows it to run on any Unix-like system.

Clone all required repositories.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tclahr/uac.git
git clone https://github.com/tclahr/ushunit.git
git clone https://github.com/tclahr/uac-tests.git
```

## How to run the tests

From the ushunit directory, run the following command to run all tests.

```shell
cd ushunit
UAC_DIR="../uac" ./ushunit -i ../uac-tests/tests/lib/* ../uac-tests/tests/*
```
